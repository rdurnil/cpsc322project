    "## Data Analysis\n",
    "Our dataset consisted almost entirely of continuous data. Even the non-continuous data was designed to be entirely unique. This meant that we were required to discritize our data in order to ensure that the desicion trees could be constructed or remove unique idenifiers before classifying the data.  \n",
    "Initially, before cleaning, the dataset had 78888 instances. After removing rows with most of the column data missing, we were left with 36699 rows of data. This was too much for our machines to compute so we pruned the data until we were left with 1050 instances with each ozone level being represented and equal number of times. "
